About Urban Company:     Home services is a large, unorganized industry in India. Indian consumers spend ~ USD 30 Billion annually on home services. They largely rely on word of mouth and friends-family recommendations for search and discovery. There is no large, well run, billion-dollar Company in this category today. The industry lacks scale benefits - standardization, transparency, and trust.     In the absence of organized players, the current market architecture is froth with middlemen and aggregators, who control market access and keep a lion s share of the margins. As a result, experiences are broken for both customers and end service professionals. The industry could easily be 1.5-2x larger than it is today if frictions in transaction journeys are removed - and experiences made more meaningful and memorable   .     What are you expected to do         Primary tasks:         1. Developing SQL/Redash/Looker queries for preparation of key Finance deliverables like Monthly MIS reports, Budgeted vs Actual performance analysis, City level financial and business analysis, Trending forecasts, AOP, etc.     2. Developing queries to enable recording, presentation, and automation of new PL line items into regular MIS reports, which may come up with new business initiatives / internal process re-alignments.     3. Working with different departments within the organization (SCM, HR, Quality, Operations, Marketing) to understand their key reporting requirements, and suggesting best ways to present data for everyday tracking and business performance reporting (using both graphical and tabular reports).     4. Developing Tableau Dashboards from scratch-     a. Defining reporting requirements with departmental HODs / FPA Lead, and marrying the same with org. reporting needs     b. Recommending ways to present data on Tableau and finalizing reporting formats     c. Setting up internal processes with Analytics team to ensure collection and update of data on dashboard created     d. Continuous improvement based on evolving needs of org/department     5. The employee will work with both Business Finance and Core Finance teams from time to time. However, primary reporting shall rest within Business Finance.     Additional tasks (that shall come up as the employee grows into his/her role):     5. Assisting Business Finance Managers / Leaders with the key analysis of critical business parameters from time to time, as well as on adhoc basis (based on requirement).     6. Generating insights into and providing recommendations on improving Business Performance.     7. Regularly coordinating with key stakeholders to update and improve upon the existing business metrics derived from Redash/ Tableau, and leading projects proactively to improve overall financial reporting analysis.        What are we looking for      1.    Experience in Business Analytics / Data analysis / Data intelligence.      2. Should have good knowledge of Redash, Tableau, SQL, VBA, and MS Excel.      3. Should be from an IT background but having exposure in a Business Analyst/Financial Analyst/Data analyst role in the past.      4. Should have worked on Tableau Dashboard development in the past.      5. Should be professional and confident enough to work directly on projects with top management.      6.
